# Functional Programming with Javascript

## Student Instructions

### Big Picture

You are going to create a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. Your dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. Your app will make use of all the functional concepts and practices you have learned in this course, and the goal is that you would become very comfortable using pure functions and iterating over, reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses.

### Getting Started

1. We'll start with the typical setup - clone theis repo and install the dependencies


```git clone https://github.com/i-shubhamprakash/Nasa-Mars-Dashboard.git```

 - [ ] For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, so to install your depencies run:

```yarn install```

**If you don’t have yarn installed globally, follow their installation documentation here according to your operating system: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

1. Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.

2. In your repo, you will see a .env file with a place for your API key. Enter in your key. Now that you have your key

3. Run `yarn start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000` to check that your app is working.
