# Mars Dashboard

This dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission.

### Getting Started

1. We'll start with the typical setup - clone theis repo and install the dependencies


```git clone https://github.com/i-shubhamprakash/Nasa-Mars-Dashboard.git```

 - [ ] For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, so to install your depencies run:

```yarn install```

**If you donâ€™t have yarn installed globally, follow their installation documentation here according to your operating system: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

1. Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.

2. In your repo, you will see a .env file with a place for your API key. Enter in your key. Now that you have your key

3. Run `yarn start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000` to check that your app is working.
